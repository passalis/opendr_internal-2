# OpenDR Multimodal Object Detection 2D - GEM

This folder contains an implementation of GEM Multimodal Object Detector in an OpenDR Learner class for 2D object detection. The input of the model is a list of two images, one from each modality e.g., RGB and Infrared, and the output consists of bounding boxes with class names and confidences.

This module currently depends on OpenDR's DETR module which is a wrapper of [facebook/detr](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr) with modifications to make them compatible with OpenDR specifications. The GEM paper can be found here: [GEM: Glare or Gloom, I Can Still See You -- End-to-End Multimodal Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12319) by Osama Mazhar, Jens Kober and Robert Babuska.

First we performed modifications in the single modal DETR which are detailed in `opendr.perception.object_detection_2d.detr` package. To support multimodal inputs and allow different fusion methods, we performed additional modifications in this package.

The modifications are:
