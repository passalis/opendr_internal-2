# Panoptic Segmentation

Panoptic segmentation combines both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation in a single task.
While distinct foreground objects, e.g., cars or pedestrians, receive instance-wise segmentation masks, background classes such as buildings or road surface are combined in class-wide labels.
