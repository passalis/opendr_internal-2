# FaceRecognition Demos

This folder contains sample applications that demonstrate various parts of the functionality provided by the FaceRecognition algorithms provided by OpenDR.

More specifically, the following applications are provided:

1. demos/inference_tutorial.ipynb: A step-by-step tutorial on how to run inference using OpenDR's implementation of FaceRecognition
2. demos/eval_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform evaluation using FaceRecognition
3. demos/inference_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform inference on a single image
4. demos/benchmarking_demo.py: A simple benchmarking tool for measuring the performance of FaceRecognition in various platforms

Please use the --device cpu flag for the demos if you are running them on a machine without a CUDA-enabled GPU.
